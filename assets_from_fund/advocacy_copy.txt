Colin, here is some basic copy for the revised / collapsed NOAF advocacy page.

I'd like to include LTEs written by our members and supporters, and studies that might be of interest to media

The New Orleans Abortion Fund is a leading voice in reproductive rights and justice, and has engaged its members, supporters and the larger community in advocacy since its founding in 2012 when it honored long-time clinic administrator Sylvia Cochran for her decades of service.

As a member of the National Network of Abortion Funds (http://abortionfunds.org) and the All* Above All (http://allaboveall.org/) coalition, NOAF works to oppose federal anti-choice legislation like the Hyde Amendment . Every year, Congress attaches a rider to the federal budget that prevents federal money from going to abortion care for people on Medicaid, Medicare for disability, federal employees, Peace Corps volunteers, people who use Indian Health Service, and many others.  

To bring attention to this harmful legislation, NOAF hosts its annual Sex Ed Bingo fundraiser where supporters can take action to oppose the law. In 2016 NOAF held its first-ever End Hyde Bike Ride.

As a founding member of the Louisiana Coalition for Reproductive Freedom, the New Orleans Abortion Fund has lead the charge against anti-choice legislation in Louisiana, beginning in 2013 when the Louisiana Department of Health issued "emergency regulations" that would have immediately closed the existing five abortion clinics. Since then, NOAF has testified in committee during the Louisiana legislative session; engaged the media in print, television and radio interviews; held press conferences and organized rallies to oppose anti-choice regulations and legislation.

In 2017 NOAF launched its "Women Pay the Price" campaign to educate and engage supporters about Louisiana abortion restrictions. We need your to help ensure abortion access for everyone. Join the fight by signing up to receive our advocacy alerts:  http://eepurl.com/2vCbz
