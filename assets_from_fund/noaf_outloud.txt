[@colinxfleming note: I have a few docs of people's stories that I'm keeping out of github, ask me for em if you need them.]

The New Orleans Abortion Fund's OutLoud is a new initiative that seeks to amplify experiences with abortion. From patients who have undergone the procedure to clinic escorts on the frontlines of anti-choice propaganda, abortion stories are everywhere. 

NOAF OutLoud aims to bring these narratives to the surface and ignite discussion about abortion by sharing stories at small house parties of friends. These informal gatherings utilize video, writing and conversation to explore our personal and professional experiences with abortion, and enlighten our understanding of reproductive health, rights and justice. 

Whether you are an intake member talking directly with NOAF clients, supporting patients as clinic escorts or have a personal abortion story to share, we invite you to join the conversation.

1 in 3 women in the U.S. will have an abortion in her lifetime. What if they all shared their stories?


I've attached the flier and several stories that can be used as links on the page.
