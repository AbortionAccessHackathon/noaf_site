Sex Ed Bingo (see attached flier)

The New Orleans Abortion Fund hosts its Sex Ed Bingo fundraiser in September to call attention to the Hyde Amendment. Every year, Congress attaches a rider to the federal budget that prevents federal money from going to abortion care for people on Medicaid, Medicare for disability, federal employees, Peace Corps volunteers, people who use Indian Health Service, and many others.  Help us fight back!

Game-a-thon (see attached pictures)

You may have raced for a cure or walked for a cause.  Well, now you can play for choice at the New Orleans Abortion Fund's annual Game-a-thon!
 
Grab a team of 4-6 people and help us destigmatize abortion and increase access!  And, after months of fundraising, bring your team to shoot pool, ping-pong, throw darts, and arm-wrestle your way to victory!
