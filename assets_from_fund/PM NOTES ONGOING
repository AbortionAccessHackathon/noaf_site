CLOSEOUT REPORT
Pleased to say that we got the bulk of the very heavy lifting done this morning, and tomorrow will be dedicated mostly to editing copy and finishing the styling.

* We're moving on to copy work for the bulk of Sunday. The live site is at https://elizabeth-yalkut.squarespace.com/ . Please feel free to gut check some of the copy, but be advised the site content will be shifting as you view it. (Relatedly, if you've ever wanted to see a website get built in real time, now's your chance!)
* We'll be sending an update on styling as soon as we can in the morning.

REQUESTS

* Do you have an SVG of the logo? If not, that's fine, but please hook us up if so!
* Social networks you want connected -- links to profile and login info if you're comfortable.

What we're not doing

* Store setup (sorry)
* Implementing stripe as a donation system; we're gonig to hew close to what you have for now

TRANSITION PLAN

* Our goal for End of Day tomorrow is as follows: Get it to a place where we can hand it over in development mode, where you can make edits to the copy as you see fit.
* If reassigning owner winds up being easy we'll do that and help you with the final rollout, otherwise we'll deliver a transition plan and help you spin up an account of your own.
* Afterwards we'll work on spinning down access, in particular removing me from the accounts I needed access to this weekend.
